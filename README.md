# AspNetCoreApp
 Task Management Systemâ€”an application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. This project is complex enough to integrate the following features:

MVC Pattern: Implement controllers, views, and models to handle task creation, updates, and displays.
Database Connection: Use Entity Framework Core to connect to an online free database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite).
Dependency Injection (DI): Inject services for database operations, authentication, and business logic.
Web API (HTTP and gRPC): Implement a RESTful API for CRUD operations on tasks and a gRPC service to handle real-time task updates.
Dual-Platform Hosting (Windows and Linux): Configure the app to run seamlessly on both platforms.
Multithreading & Parallel Calls: Use multithreading for complex operations, such as batch task creation, and parallel calls for data processing.
Design Patterns: Apply common design patterns, such as the Repository pattern for data access and the Singleton pattern for services.
Authentication: Implement user authentication with Identity and JWT tokens.
Pagination: Allow users to page through a large number of tasks.
Virtual Keyword: Use virtual properties in entity classes to enable lazy loading with Entity Framework.
