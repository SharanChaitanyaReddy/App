# AspNetCoreApp
 Task Management Systemâ€”an application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. This project is complex enough to integrate the following features:

MVC Pattern: Implement controllers, views, and models to handle task creation, updates, and displays.
Database Connection: Use Entity Framework Core to connect to an online free database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite).
Dependency Injection (DI): Inject services for database operations, authentication, and business logic.
Web API (HTTP and gRPC): Implement a RESTful API for CRUD operations on tasks and a gRPC service to handle real-time task updates.
Dual-Platform Hosting (Windows and Linux): Configure the app to run seamlessly on both platforms.
Multithreading & Parallel Calls: Use multithreading for complex operations, such as batch task creation, and parallel calls for data processing.
Design Patterns: Apply common design patterns, such as the Repository pattern for data access and the Singleton pattern for services.
Authentication: Implement user authentication with Identity and JWT tokens.
Pagination: Allow users to page through a large number of tasks.
Virtual Keyword: Use virtual properties in entity classes to enable lazy loading with Entity Framework.


setup of Task Management ASP.NET Core App - Database, Entity Framework, Repository Pattern, and API


Set up and configured a SQL database for task management, including schema creation.
Integrated Entity Framework Core for database operations, configured with the necessary context and mappings.
Implemented the repository pattern with Entity Framework to handle CRUD operations efficiently.
Created and exposed API controllers specifically for task management functions, supporting full CRUD operations.
Added authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API.
Utilized .NET Core-specific functionalities:
Dependency Injection (DI) for managing services and repositories.
Delegates and Delegation to implement specific logic and callback mechanisms within the application.
Configured DI for seamless integration of services and repositories throughout the app.
